height 					- height of the thumb
maxzoom 				- the maximum zoom level, equal to the deepest period level
minzoom 				- minimum zoom level
periods 				- JSON object representing the periods, optionally hierarchical
scrollspeed				- scroll speed for autoscroll feature, 0 to disable autoscroll
step					- minimal width (in pixels) of the period in the timeline
to						- index of the last period in selection
zoom					- initial zoom level

EVENTS:
To add an eventlistener, add this to the option list on init: onEventName: function(){do stuff}
onAutoScroll			- triggered when timelineslider is autoscrolling (when thumb is dragged beyond the viewpane)
onCreate				- triggered right after creation of the timelineslider 
onScaleStart			- triggered when the left or right thumb handles start to get dragged

TODO: calculate step size for exact period fit, based on preferred width (step parameter) OR ANY OTHER SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM
TODO: autoscroll on scale
TODO: Show period status (data/no data)
TODO: Show indicator

KNOWN BUG: thumb is centered after scroll when it was at maximum position
KNOWN BUG: can't select last period when step is not exactly right to fit in screen
KNOWN BUG: destroy doesn't work
